I work in the area of Machine Learning (ML) based Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods with a primary focus on speech and text data. I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering in 2017 and have been working in the industry since then, trying to advance state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP) based systems. 

I started my PhD during very exciting times when the field of natural language processing that traditionally straddled both signal processing (mainly for audio data) and old school statistical learning, was at the cusp of being revolutionized by a new wave of Deep Neural Network (DNN) based systems. We have made more progress in the last decade than any of the past decades since 1950s. The number of applications that can be deployed in the real world have exploded, specially for English language. In the past years, I've worked on building a number of AI based solutions such as scoring high stakes English tests (TOEFL), developing an English language learning app for elementary school students, transcribing doctor patient conversations in hospitals, building voice biometrics based security solutions, speaker diarization module for audio recordings with multiple speakers and many more.
