I work in the area of Machine Learning (ML) based Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods with a primary focus on speech and text data. I obtained my PhD in Electrical Engineering in 2017 with a specialization in signal processing. 

I started my PhD back in 2011, during very exciting times when the field of natural language processing that traditionally straddled both signal processing (mainly for audio data) and old school statistical learning, was at the cusp of being revolutionized by a new wave of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) based methods. My dissertation was on alleviating language mismatch in voice biometrics systems. Just like finger prints, our voice also carries our identity. However, it becomes harder to verify multi-lingual speakers as
